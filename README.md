# discord-listening.py
A small program to let your last.fm status appear on your discord profile. So you are no longer required to use Spotify only!

## How it works
You have to have the following:

- a [last.fm](https://last.fm) account

- a [last.fm API key](https://last.fm/api)

- a [Discord Client ID](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)

- a music streaming service that supports last.fm like

      -TIDAL
      -Deezer
      -YouTube
      ...and more

##  Set-Up
Run the program after you have entered your API keys and the Client ID, and look on discord. Now you can play Music and it'll update in seconds!

## How I "compiled" the script and why
No, it's not because of DRM (bruh)
It's because exe is easier to manage under Windows than .py, you can add it to your auto-start, you don't need dependencys and more.
